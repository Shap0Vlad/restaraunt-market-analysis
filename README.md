Exploratory data analysis of U.S. restaurant chains (Top 250, Independence 100, Future50)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes growth patterns of restaurant chains across different segments
to understand what drives revenue expansion, scalability, and long-term performance.

The analysis focuses on three strategic perspectives:
- Top-performing large chains
- Independent operators
- Fast-growing emerging brands

## Business Questions
The project aims to answer the following high-level business questions:
- What factors have the strongest relationship with revenue growth?
- Does network expansion translate into sales growth?
- How do franchised and non-franchised models differ in performance?
- Are high-performing units more likely to sustain growth?

## Data
The analysis is based on three datasets:
- `Top250.csv` — large, established restaurant chains
- `Independence100.csv` — independent operators
- `Future50.csv` — fast-growing emerging brands

The datasets originate from a publicly available Kaggle.
